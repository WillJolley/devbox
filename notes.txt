3/3/24: - Having the jumping mechanism in the eventlistener switch case
(i.e. changing the Orb's velocity there) results in a repeatable one
jump per press and you can continue to guide the Orb with left/right
arrows mid-air. Whereas using the eventlistener switch case to only 
register key-presses/releases and placing the jumping code in the 
main draw/animate function, you can continuously move up by holding 
down the jump key, but if you try to add directional movement at the 
same time, the Orb falls. Additionally, if you try to jump from the 
ground while using directional keys, it doesn't register. 
 * correction - actually if you hold down the jump key in the first case 
 the orb also flies

3/8: - Camera box - style scrolling seems ideal; have the screen scroll 
according to the position of the orb and its proximity to top and bottom.
Currently messing around with attaching the scroll to the jump button, 
which unfortunately hides what you've passed. Maybe I can combine the 
camera box with the scrolling variable!
