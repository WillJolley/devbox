## Description

Climb Orb is a vertical platformer game-like experience wherein the user compels a jumping orb to climb a never-ending series of platforms inside an interminably tall library. It is also very much a work-in-progress. 

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open index.html in your browser. 
3. Move left and right with the arrow keys; jump with the Z key. 

## Known Bugs

- Platform collision-detection is prone to failure in general and doesn't work at all if the orb falls a considerable distance.
- Platforms stop generating after scrolling past the first two backgrounds. 
- Platforms are not always close enough for the orb to reach. 
- The orb has infinite hops and outpaces the scrolling / leaves the screen if you make it fly. 
- There is no scrolling / background replication when the orb descends.
